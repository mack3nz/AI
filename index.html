  <h1>Artificial Intelligence in Modern Systems</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Text</h2>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the way modern systems operate. It refers to machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. These systems can analyze large amounts of data, recognize patterns, and make decisions without human intervention.</p>
    <p>Today, AI is being used in various fields such as healthcare, finance, education, and transportation. For example, AI is helping doctors to diagnose diseases more accurately and quickly. In finance, it is used to detect fraud and manage investments.</p>
    <p>Modern systems are becoming more intelligent every day. They are not only performing tasks but also learning from experience. This process is called machine learning, and it is a core part of AI.</p>
    <p>The future of AI is very promising. Companies and developers are working on systems that can interact with humans in natural language, drive cars, and even create art. AI is changing the world, and we are just at the beginning.</p>
